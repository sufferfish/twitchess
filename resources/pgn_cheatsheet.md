# How to Move
If you are starting as white and wish to move the pawn in front of your king up two spaces, you would reply with "e4". One you next move, say you with to move your kingside knight. You may reply with "Nf3." The game continues in such fashion.

Please note that captures are notated as such: "Nxd4." This says that the knight took a piece on d4.

Checks are notated with a "+" sign afterwards.

Castling on kingside is noted with: "O-O" while queenside castling is notated: "O-O-O".
